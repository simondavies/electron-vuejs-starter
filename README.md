# Electron Vue JS Starter
A simple basic Electron base set up featuring ES6 features adn Vue JS.  Some type of boilerplate to start a/add to project, to save time.


For the moment to install, clone the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:simondavies/electron-vuejs-starter.git
```

```
cd electron-vuejs-starter
```


Once you have entered the folder first you will need to run the following within terminal (MAC):

```
sudo npm install
```

Once all the packages have downloaded, run:

```
gulp
```

This should run the gulp process and set up the css and js files for running the app.

So that's all done you say...! No lets see if that works as seemingly as it should first time. Within the terminal run the following code.

```
npm start
```

Once loaded for now you should see a dark window with some text and the developers tools open. Some of the text is created via Vue JS to verify it is working too.

Anyway i have more to do and test for now to make sure it all works as it should and also some visual niceties to add to.
